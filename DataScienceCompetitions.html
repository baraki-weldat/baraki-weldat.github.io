        <br>
        Submissions -Usually you are asked to submit only predictions
        <br>
        Evaluations - Evaluations Functions -You need to know how good is your model. The quality of the model is defined by evaluation functions. <br/>
        (Predictions, Right Answers) => Score E.g. Accuracy, Logistic Loss, AUC, RMSE, MAE
        Leaderboards
